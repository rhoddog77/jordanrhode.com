    	<h1>History</h1>
        <p><i>The Trek</i> began in my college years as I began to try to come to grips with my past - and my present.  I was dealing with the emotions of years of abuse and the struggles I kept having with failed relationships with both family and friends.  It was not a "happy" time for me as I began to search for some way of moving forward.<br/><br/>
        As I began to heal, I had the opportunity to work with teenagers through a nonprofit organization.  I was handed a group of boys and told to "teach them something".  I dug out my notes from my college years and, on my vacation, wrote "Self-Image".  Because of their positive reaction and request for more, I spent much of my personal time in the next year writing follow-up classes.  Then, when I left the organization, I took all of my notes and put them away.<br/><br/>
        In 2011, I was given the opportunity to present a break-out session at a seminar.  I began to search through my notes and found the outline I had written - but never completed - for "Forgiveness".  I spent a weekend creating the first class in what my wife called “The Trek”.<br/><br/>
        When people told me how much they connected to the class, I decided to bring out the rest of the material, update it and see if it would change the lives of others as it did mine so long ago.  <i>The Trek</i> is based on input, feedback and many personal stories from many coworkers and friends; along with a lot of advice and assistance from my wife, Maria.  My thanks go out to all of you who have shared your lives to help others!</p><p><span class="bold">All of us at <i>The Trek</i> wish you all the best on your own journey!</span></p>
